-body snapshot sprite renders body once
 -refactor: split 'DrawnThing2D' out of Body
 -BodySnapshotSprite copies the 'DrawnThing2D'
 -render once and done
-body snapshot rerenders as necessary
-body snapshot is only used on certain platforms

Batching on, 480 Polygon2Ds, 60 fps
Batching on, 1920 Polygon2Ds, 3 fps
Batching off, 480 Polygon2Ds, 3 fps
Batching off, 1920 Polygon2Ds, 1 fps


Batching on, 1920 Polygon2Ds, single rect fallback, 50-60 fps
Batching on, 1920 Polygon2Ds, single rect fallback, scissor area threshold 0.1: 50-60 fps

Polygon2D is extremely slow compared to Sprite rendering  https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/19943

https://gist.github.com/jshorty/4090ba064ca0d3634d040e7a70c4833a Render an arbitrary polygon as a sprite


https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/53537 is being updated as we speak -- so, there may be a workaround like "Disable the rect flicker workaround on Android" or "Turn off the single_rect_fallback setting"
