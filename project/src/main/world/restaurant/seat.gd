## The 'seat' scene includes a creature and some furniture, all of which cast shadows. But the 'seat' scene does not
## contain the shadows itself, since they need to appear behind other objects outside of this scene.
##
## This script contains logic for scaling an injected 'creature shadow' object as the creature grows in size.
