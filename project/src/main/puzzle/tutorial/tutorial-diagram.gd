## Displays a diagram during a tutorial.
##

## to ensure they understand the diagram.

## Emitted when the player clicks a button indicating they understand the diagram
signal ok_chosen

## Emitted when the player clicks a button indicating they don't understand the diagram
signal help_chosen

## The number of times the diagram has been shown. We cycle through different chat choices each time.
